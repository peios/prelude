# shellcheck shell=sh
# pt-hook.sh — the scripted-hook library, staged at /fixtures/pt-hook.sh.
#
# Sourced by every hook this profile stages, and available to any hook a
# test injects with `files`. It does two things.
#
# **It reports.** Everything a test needs to know about a hook run goes to
# stderr as one line, which prelude's console carries and provium captures
# even when the boot goes on to halt:
#
#   pt|<hook>|pass=2|pid=57|cwd=/|argc=0|arg0=/usr/libexec/…|env=PATH=…,TERM=linux,|spec=defer:2
#   pt|<hook>|outcome=deferred
#
# The console is the oracle rather than a file on the real root because a
# hook runs before there is a real root to write to, and because half the
# behaviour worth testing ends with prelude halting, at which point no
# file anywhere is reachable.
#
# **It obeys the kernel command line.** A hook's behaviour comes from
# `pt.<hook>=<spec>`, so one initramfs covers every scenario and a test
# chooses between them with `kernel_cmdline_append` instead of a rebuild:
#
#   ok            exit 0 — satisfied (the default when no spec is given)
#   decline       exit 69
#   defer         exit 75, every time: the hook that never becomes ready
#   defer:<n>     exit 75 until the n-th run, then act and exit 0
#   fail          exit 1
#   fail:<code>   exit <code> — for the codes prelude must treat as failure
#   signal        SIGTERM itself: killed by a signal, never an exit code
#   sleep:<secs>  sleep, then exit 0
#
# Sourced, not executed: `$#` and `$0` are the hook's own, which is how
# the argv prelude passes gets reported.
