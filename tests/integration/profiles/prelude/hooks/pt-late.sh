# The hook that runs last, and the profile's stand-in for the packaged
# hook that assembles the real root's views once something has mounted it.
#
# It declares one of each kind of consumption, because between them they
# are the whole of prelude's scheduling:
#
#   requires   rootfs-ready must be ACHIEVED — every contributor finished
#              — so this hook cannot run before the root is mounted. It is
#              also what makes a declined or deferred mount hook
#              observable from here rather than only from prelude's own
#              refusal a phase later.
#   after      a capability nothing in this image supplies. Settled
#              vacuously, so it must not hold this hook back at all. That
#              is the property that lets a shared capability vocabulary
#              survive an image that implements none of it, and it is
#              silent when it breaks — the hook would simply never run.
