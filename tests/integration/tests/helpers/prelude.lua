-- Helpers for the prelude chapter: building the files a test injects
-- into the initramfs at boot, and reading what came back on the console.
--
-- The profile (`profiles/prelude/`) bakes an initramfs holding real
-- prelude, dash, peiosutils, three staged hooks and the payload that
-- becomes the real root. A test that wants a different hook graph does
-- not rebuild it: it writes its own `hooks.seq.2` and its own hook
-- scripts through `vm:boot({files = ...})`, which the kernel unpacks over
-- the baked tree.
--
-- Everything a hook does is reported on the console as a `pt|` line (see
-- `profiles/prelude/fixtures/pt-hook.sh`), and prelude's own progress
-- lines are beside them, so the console log is the oracle for everything
-- that happens before the handoff — including for a boot that halts,
-- where the console text arrives in `vm:boot()`'s error.
