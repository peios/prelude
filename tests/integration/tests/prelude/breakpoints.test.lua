-- Area D: breakpoints and the rescue shell.
--
-- `rd.break` is the one part of prelude that needs a human at the other
-- end of the console, which is why it had no coverage until now: the
-- shell prelude forks inherits prelude's stdin, a test has no way to
-- type into it, and a boot that stops at a breakpoint never reaches an
-- agent — `vm:boot` fails on the agent timeout with the guest already
-- torn down.
--
-- The way in is that `RESCUE_SHELL` is a path — `/usr/bin/sh`, dash's
-- own — and a path is a thing a test can replace. Two stand-ins are
-- injected here, both of which fall through to the real dash for every
-- other caller (the hooks' `#!/usr/bin/sh` shebang among them), and both
-- of which recognise prelude's rescue invocation by its `-i`:
--
--   RESCUE_SH   reports the argv and environment prelude handed it and
--               exits at once. That turns every breakpoint into a
--               resumable one, so the whole of `rd.break` — where it
--               stops, what it matches, what it implies — is assertable
--               on a boot that goes on to complete.
--   FEEDING_SH  execs the *real* dash, `-i`, reading a script this test
--               injected. So one case runs the shipped shell,
--               interactively, and lets it exit on its own.
--
-- One case deliberately keeps the shipped dash untouched and asserts on
-- what it printed to the console before the boot timed out — that is
-- where argv0 and the interactive prompt are visible, and no stand-in
-- could show them.
