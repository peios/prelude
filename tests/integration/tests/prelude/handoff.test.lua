-- Area E, first half: the root check and the handoff.
--
-- Everything here happens after the last hook has run, when prelude is
-- alone again: it decides whether anybody actually mounted a root, moves
-- the kernel filesystems across, empties the initramfs it booted from,
-- and chroots into what it found. Claims E1-E10.
--
-- Two oracles, and the split between them is the whole shape of this
-- file. prelude's console says what it did; the agent it exec'd — which
-- is running inside the new root, with the moved mounts under it — says
-- what survived. The initramfs itself is unreachable by the time anyone
-- can be asked a question, so a test that wants to know what the cleanup
-- walk did has to arrange for the answer to be visible from the far
-- side: a hook binds the directory in question into the new root before
-- the walk runs, and the agent reads it back through that bind.
