-- The hook contract's second half: what prelude hands a hook, and what a
-- hook may say back.
--
-- Everything a hook receives comes from one `fork` + `execve` in
-- `spawn_and_wait` — a two-variable environment, an argv of one element,
-- no pipe on either output stream — and everything it can say comes back
-- through one `waitpid` status, which `run_one_hook` and `wait_failure`
-- decode into exactly three non-failure outcomes and a failure for
-- everything else.
--
-- The console is the oracle on both sides. A hook's own report line
-- (`pt|<hook>|env=…|argc=…`) says what it was handed; prelude's log line
-- says what prelude made of what it said back. For the codes prelude
-- refuses, the machine halts and the console arrives in `vm:boot()`'s
-- error instead.
