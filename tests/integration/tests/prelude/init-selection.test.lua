-- Area E, second half, and area F: choosing an init, and giving up.

-- By the time prelude reaches phase 8 it is standing inside the new root
-- with nothing left to do but replace itself. It has a list of paths to
-- try — whatever `init=` named, then the fallback chain — and it works
-- down it until an execve takes. Claims E11-E16.
--
-- If anything before that went wrong, prelude does not limp: it says so,
-- re-reads the command line for the debug knobs, and halts the machine.
-- Claims F1-F5. A test for one of those asserts on the console text that
-- comes back in the boot's failure, because there is no agent left to
-- ask — which is itself the point.
--
-- The lever throughout is a hook that mounts the root and then rearranges
-- what prelude will find in it (`prelude.root_hook`). Phase 8 is prelude
-- alone, so the only way to steer it is to change the root it is about
-- to look at.
