-- prelude's scheduler, as pass mechanics: what each pass runs, what
-- counts as progress, what happens when a pass achieves nothing, and what
-- prelude logs on the way through.
--
-- The scheduler makes repeated passes over the sequence, running whatever
-- is ready and leaving deferred hooks pending for a later pass. Only a
-- terminal outcome — Satisfied or Declined — is progress; a pass that
-- makes none while work remains is a dead end, and prelude ends the boot
-- there with a per-hook diagnosis rather than spinning.
--
-- The capability semantics behind readiness — settled versus achieved —
-- are in capabilities.test.lua. Every graph here that expects a handoff
-- keeps the profile's root-mounting hook, and so does every graph that
-- expects a halt: with a root mounted, a halt can only have come from the
-- scheduler and not from the root check a phase later.
