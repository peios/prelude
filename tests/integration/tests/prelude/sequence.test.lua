-- Area B: choosing and parsing the hook sequence.
--
-- Before prelude runs anything it has to decide *what* to run, and that
-- decision is made from file names alone: every `hooks.seq.<n>` in
-- /system/prelude is a candidate at version <n>, the unsuffixed
-- /hooks.seq is a candidate at version 0, and the highest version this
-- prelude can parse wins. Only then is the file opened, its marker
-- checked against the version its name claimed, and its body parsed.
--
-- Everything here is injection: the profile's initramfs carries one
-- resolved graph, and a test that wants a different sequence — a
-- version from the future, a marker that disagrees with the name, a
-- stanza prelude must refuse — writes its own over the baked one.
--
-- Two claims cannot be reached from a guest at all. mkirf writes BOTH
-- hooks.seq.1 and hooks.seq.2 into every image, and `files` injection
-- can only overwrite a path, never remove one, so "no sequence at all"
-- and "only a sequence newer than prelude supports" are unreachable —
-- and so, in turn, is any boot that selects version 0 or 1. Those three
-- are documented skips against prelude's own unit tests.
