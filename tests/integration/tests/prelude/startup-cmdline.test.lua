-- prelude, area A continued: the knobs prelude takes off the kernel
-- command line once /proc is mounted, and the banner that is the first
-- thing to obey them.
--
-- Everything here is asserted on the console, because the console is
-- what these knobs are about: peios.quiet=2 decides which lines exist,
-- TERM decides which bytes they are made of, and the banner is the one
-- piece of output that is neither a log line nor a hook's.
--
-- The profile's own command line already carries `TERM=dumb` (so a test
-- matching prelude's text is not matching escape sequences too), which
-- makes it the fixture for colour-off; a test that wants colour ON
-- appends `TERM=linux`, and the last occurrence is the one prelude
-- honours.
--
-- The mounts, the /dev seed and the read itself are in startup.test.lua.
