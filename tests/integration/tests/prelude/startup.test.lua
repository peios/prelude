-- prelude, area A: everything that happens before the first hook runs.
--
-- Phase 0 makes the rootfs private, phase 1 mounts /proc, /sys and /dev,
-- re-seeds /dev's security descriptor, and only then reads
-- /proc/cmdline. That ordering is the whole subject of this file: it is
-- what decides which mount options the kernel filesystems carry into the
-- new root, whether a mount failure is survivable, and which single line
-- of prelude's output escapes every command-line knob.
--
-- The three mounts are witnessed from the far side of the handoff —
-- prelude MS_MOVEs them into the new root, so the agent's
-- /proc/self/mountinfo is prelude's own mount table. Everything else is
-- witnessed on the console, which carries prelude's log lines whether
-- the boot completes or halts.
--
-- The command-line knobs themselves (peios.quiet, TERM, init=) and the
-- banner are in startup-cmdline.test.lua.
